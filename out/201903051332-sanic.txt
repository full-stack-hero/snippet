Sanic is a Python web server and web framework that's written to go fast. It allows the usage of the async/await syntax added in Python 3.5, which makes your code non-blocking and speedy. 
The goal of the project is to provide a simple way to get up and running a highly performant HTTP server that is easy to build, to expand, and ultimately to scale.
