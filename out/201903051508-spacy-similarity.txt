spaCy is able to compare two objects, and make a prediction of how similar they are. Predicting similarity is useful for building recommendation systems or flagging duplicates. 
For example, you can suggest a user content that's similar to what they're currently looking at, or label a support ticket as a duplicate if it's very similar to an already existing one. 
Download the model "en_core_web_md" to try this example python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
